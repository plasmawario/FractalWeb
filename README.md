# FractalWeb
Fractal Web is a free webpage featuring several fractal tools allowing you to play around with fractals. Currently in open beta, some features are broken, bugs may occur, and improvements are needed in some areas. (zooming into fractals are a pain currently, sorry!) Hopefully you'll be able to get a kick out of what I have right now however. Any suggestions, bug reports, and/or comments are welcome!
