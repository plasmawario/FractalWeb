# FractalWeb
This is a beta of a webpage featuring several fractal tools allowing you to play around with fractals. Some features are broken, bugs may occur, and improvements are needed in some areas. (zooming into fractals are a pain currently, sorry!) Hopefully you'll be able to get a kick out of what i have right now however
